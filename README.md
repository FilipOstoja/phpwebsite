# PHP Basics
Currently following the laracasts.com PHP For Beginners course and I plan to follow "the path". The website offers a roadmap of mastering PHP, Laravel and various frontend technologies among other things.
This course is project based and helps me learn the basics of PHP and programming. 
When the course and project is finished I believe i will master the basics and have a nice website with the fundamentals such as CRUD and Login system operations.
